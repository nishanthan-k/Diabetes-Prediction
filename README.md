# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This repository contains code and resources for predicting diabetes using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Predicting diabetes in advance can help in early detection and effective management of the disease. This project aims to build a machine learning model using Support Vector Machines to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the SVM model.
- `notebooks/`: This directory includes Jupyter notebooks with the code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: This directory stores the trained SVM model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3 (version 3.6 or higher)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)
